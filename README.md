PathVisioRPC is an XML-RPC implementation of PathVisio that allows users to create and edit biological pathways, visualize data on pathways, perform pathway statistics and exports results in various image formats. Since most major programming languages have a library/module providing XML-RPC functionality, this application enables users to access PathVisio functionality from their favourite analytical environment.
